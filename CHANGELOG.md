# Changelog

## 2.0.0

A rewrite from a single-site script pack into an installable, config-driven tool.

- `init`, `doctor`, `run`, `state` commands; `npx github:bishal-paul-git/seo-autopilot#v2 init` scaffolds config, data files and workflows into any repo.
- Multi-site config, content adapters (sitemap, JSON, Markdown).
- New jobs: weekly keyword research, news watcher (RSS/Atom), weekly digest with GA4, topic proposals, weekly "request indexing" list, drip scheduling and release, unlinked-mention finder, backlink submitter with daily cap, retry and full logging, hand-done checklist.
- Self-contained HTML dashboard; optional Supabase dashboard template.
- Approval-gated drafting workflow (issue label, pull request, merge).
- Fixed a state-saving bug that nested a `reports` folder on every run.

## 0.1.0

Initial release: daily report, IndexNow, onboarding skill.
